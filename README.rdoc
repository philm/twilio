= Twilio Gem

The Twilio gem provides two major pieces of functionality: (1) a Ruby wrapper for the Twilio REST API and (2) response handlers based on the Twilio Markup XML (TwiML).

See http://www.twilio.com/docs/index for Twilio's API documentation.

== Calling the Twilio REST API

First set your credentials by calling the connect method:

  Twilio.connect('my_twilio_sid', 'my_auth_token')
  
Now call any of the Twilio classes:
  
  Twilio::Call.make('1234567890', '9876543210', 'http://mysite.com/connected_call')
  Twilio::Recording.list
  
== Responding to Twilio

When Twilio calls your application URL, your response must use the Twilio Markup XML (http://www.twilio.com/docs/api_reference/TwiML/). The Twilio gem makes this very easy 
by providing a Twilio Verb class. 

For example, in a Ruby on Rails application, you could do the following inside a controller class:

  Twilio::Verb.dial '415-123-4567'
  
and you can nest multiple verbs inside a block:

  verb = Twilio::Verb.new { |v|
    v.say "The time is #{Time.now}"
    v.hangup
  }
  verb.response
